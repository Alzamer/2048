# Game Rules
The game is played on a 4x4 grid.
The objective is to combine tiles with the same number to create a tile with the number 2048.
You can move the tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with the sum of their numbers.
After each move, a new tile with a value of either 2 or 4 is randomly added to the grid.
The game is won when a tile with the number 2048 is created.
The game is over when there are no more valid moves, i.e., no empty spaces and no adjacent tiles with the same number.
# Controls
Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) on your keyboard to move the tiles.
# To do
- move animation after a tile moves
